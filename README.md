# raymarching
A WebGL shader that does raymarching! Demo link: https://raymarching-ten.vercel.app/

For this specific project, I've just rendered out a simple, abstract scene with a glowy black blob and a few cubes spinning around it.

## What is raymarching?
It's a technique you can use to render stuff - just like raytracing. It's similar to ray tracing, but it's not the same. Sebastian Lague has an excellent [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cp5WWtMoeKg) on the subject.

## controls
there are none! just sit back and enjoy the visual :)
